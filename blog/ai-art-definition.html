                <p>
                    This issue is a very controversial one in today's society. With the rise of AI generated "art", many artists and creators have expressed their concern that AI art is not "real art". Is this really the case? This article seeks to explore multiple perspectives on this issue.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the most common ways to define art is using the dictionary definition. Art is defined as, "the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power." Proponents for AI art would argue that while AI art does not involve direct human creative skill, it does involve human imagination. They will often bring photography as a concept as "proof" that AI-generated art is still art, as photography is not directly made by people either. Opponents of AI art argue that photography is still art because it involves a human choosing what to photograph and manually editing the work afterwards.
                    <br><br>
                    AI-generated art, from an objective standpoint, is reaching a level where it looks similar to human-created art. However, artists argue that art is also based on the process of creating the art, and that AI art lacks this.
                    <br><br>
                    In my opinion, AI art can be considered art, but AI "artists" are not artists. A good analogy to this is food. A microwave can create edible food, just like AI can create visually appealing images. However, if a person uses a microwave to cook a dish, they are not considered a chef. Similarly, if a person uses AI to create art, they are not considered an artist. This works because the artwork itself can be considered art, as visually it is identical to human-created art. 
                    <br><br>
                    The largest argument against this is that AI-generated art itself does not count as art, because it isn't wholly original and based off existing images. However, this argument can be applied to human made art as well. Artists use references and inspiration from other works all the time, and no art is truly original. Thus, I believe that AI art can be considered art, but the person using the AI is not an artist.
